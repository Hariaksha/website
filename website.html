                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Hariaksha Gunda, but I go by Hari. I currently study 
                    Computer Science (CS) and German at the University of Alabama, while also enrolled in an accelerated MBA
                    program. I made this website as a personal project to practice my HTML/CSS skills and learn more about
                    technology.
                </p>

                <p>I have a keen interest in technology, linguistics, and business. I love spending free time 
                    running, lifting, reading, and socializing with friends. Feel free to check out my reading list and workouts 
                    at my Goodreads and Strava!
                </p>

                <p>I will become a software developer after completing my education, but my ultimate goal is to combine my 
                    passions for technology and business; I want to work in Tech Biz Ops (business operations) 
                    and strategy roles in tech. For now, I am looking for software development roles (co-ops 
                    and internships) to enhance my CS background.
                </p>

                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>In May 2023, I began creating <span>personal coding projects</span> and hosting them on my 
                    GitHub (linked above) to give myself coding practice and new learning opportunities. For example, 
                    this website was created while I was learning HTML and CSS with Scrimba's 
                    <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/htmlandcss" target="_blank">HTML/CSS introductory course</a> online.
                </p>

                <p>I am also working on additional projects to add to my coding portfolio and enhance
                    my coding skills. Additionally, since 
                    <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#developer-roles-dev-type-us">most developers</a> 
                    work on full-stack development, my next projects are creating basic frontends and backends with React 
                    and Flask, respectively. To accomplish this, I am using Scrimba courses to learn 
                    <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript">JS</a>
                    and <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact">React</a>.
                </p>

                <p>My work experience and personal coding projects are available on LinkedIn and GitHub. 
                    Feel free to reach out if you would like to collaborate on any (open-source) projects!

                <h2>Other</h2>
                <p>Some fun facts about me that are that I speak three languages (proficiently, not fluently), 
                    I love traveling (across the United States and the world), and my favorite author is 
                    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38550.Brandon_Sanderson">Brandon Sanderson</a>.
                </p>
                <p>A personal goal of mine is to perfect my German and live in Germany for one year. I'm also
                    interested in learning Brazilian Portuguese after German!
